This SCSS code is designed to define and manage container widths for a responsive layout, similar to how Bootstrap handles container elements. The containers are used to align and center content while providing responsive behavior at different breakpoints.

### Breakdown of the Code:

#### **`@if $enable-container-classes`**
   - The code block is wrapped in a conditional that checks if the container classes are enabled. This makes it easy to toggle container functionality on or off globally.

#### **`make-container()` Mixin**
   - **`.bt-container` and `.bt-container-fluid`**:
     - These two classes are the base containers. 
     - **`.bt-container`**: Usually has a fixed width that changes with breakpoints.
     - **`.bt-container-fluid`**: Always takes up 100% of the width, regardless of screen size.
     - The `make-container()` mixin is likely responsible for setting up the containerâ€™s padding, width, and other properties.

#### **Responsive Containers (`@each` loop)**
   - **`.bt-container-#{$breakpoint}`**:
     - This loop creates classes for each breakpoint defined in `$container-max-widths`.
     - The class name format is `.bt-container-{breakpoint}`, where `{breakpoint}` is replaced by the actual breakpoint name like `sm`, `md`, `lg`, etc.
     - Each of these classes inherits the `bt-container-fluid` class, making them fluid until a specific breakpoint is reached.
   
#### **Media Query Adjustments (`@include media-breakpoint-up`)**
   - For each breakpoint, a media query is generated using `media-breakpoint-up`.
   - Inside each media query, a `%responsive-container-#{$breakpoint}` placeholder is created that sets a `max-width` based on the `$container-max-width` value associated with that breakpoint.
   
#### **Extending Responsive Containers**
   - **Nested `@each` loop**:
     - This loop extends the responsive container styles to each smaller or equal breakpoint.
     - The code dynamically generates container classes for all possible combinations of breakpoints using the `breakpoint-infix()` function.
     - The loop stops extending once it reaches the current breakpoint being processed, thanks to the `$extend-breakpoint` flag.

### Example of How It Works:

- Suppose you have breakpoints like `sm`, `md`, `lg`, etc., with corresponding container widths defined in `$container-max-widths`.
- The code will create:
  - `.bt-container-sm`, `.bt-container-md`, etc., each behaving like `.bt-container-fluid` up to their respective breakpoints.
  - Once the viewport width matches or exceeds a given breakpoint (e.g., `sm`), the max-width is applied to contain the content within a centered, fixed-width container.
  - The nested loop ensures that smaller breakpoints inherit the properties from larger ones.
